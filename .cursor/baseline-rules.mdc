_"ALWAYS READ THIS DOCS RULES BEFORE WRITING CODE, ALWAYS KNOW REQUIREMENTS BEFORE WRITING CODE"_

Baseline rules:
- Always focus on writing clean code & DRY principles no code should be hardcoded, repeated or duplicated.


# Nextjs/ Frontend:
- Use Next.js 16 latest feature like cache components, partial prerendering, server components, client components, Server Actions, React Compiler, etc.
- Don't use emoji's randomly in the UI 
- Don't hardcode tailwind classes, use tailwind theming system, since we are in multi-theme project.

Database:
- Always create migration files for database changes.
