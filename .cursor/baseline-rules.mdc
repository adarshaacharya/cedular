_"ALWAYS READ THIS DOCS RULES BEFORE WRITING CODE, ALWAYS KNOW REQUIREMENTS BEFORE WRITING CODE"_

## Tech stack:

- Next.js 16 (with server components, and server actions)
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shadcn UI
- Prisma
- Better Auth
- Vercel Workflow
- AI SDK v6
- Zod

## Baseline rules:

- Always focus on writing clean code & DRY principles no code should be hardcoded, repeated or duplicated.
- Dont create markdown docs unless I ask for it.
- Dont build project unless user asks for it.
- All components, hooks, libs, actions shoudl live nearby their respective page, only move to global components, lib or services if they are used in multiple pages.

## Nextjs/ Frontend:

- Use Next.js 16 latest feature like cache components, partial prerendering, server components, client components, Server Actions, React Compiler, etc.
- Don't use emoji's randomly in the UI
- Don't hardcode tailwind classes / color, use tailwind theming system, since we are in multi-theme project.
- Use the frontend design skills to make the design exceptional and unique.


## Backend:

- Most of the time we will be using server actions for database operations so no api routes will be needed.
- Use zod for schema validation for server actions, prisma for database operations, vercel workflow for background jobs, ai sdk v6 for ai operations.
- If some db calls are repeated in multiple server actiosn create reusable service functions.


## Database:

- Always create migration files for database changes using prisma cli



## AI SDK v6:

- aI sdk has v6 version which is still in beta (its really stable and production ready), but we will be using it for all ai related operations. Please do search for the latest documentation and examples before writing code. Link : https://v6.ai-sdk.
